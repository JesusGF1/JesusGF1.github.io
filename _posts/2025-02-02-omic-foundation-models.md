# Why do omic foundation models keep failing?


Genomic Foundationless Models: Pretraining Does Not Promise Performance

Deep learning-based predictions of gene perturbation effects do not yet outperform simple linear methods


Foundation models struggle with omic tasks such as gene perturbation prediction and genome representation due to a combination of intrinsic biological complexity and methodological limitations. Hereâ€™s a structured breakdown of the key reasons:

Data Challenges:

Sparsity and High Dimensionality: Omic data (e.g., gene expression, epigenetics) often has thousands of features but limited samples, leading to overfitting.

Noise and Variability: Technical artifacts (e.g., batch effects) and biological variability reduce signal-to-noise ratios, complicating model generalization.

Privacy and Accessibility: Sensitive genomic data restricts large-scale data aggregation, limiting training data diversity and volume.

Biological Complexity:

Non-linear Interactions: Gene regulation involves intricate feedback loops, epistasis, and context-dependent interactions that are hard to model.

Multi-modality and Dynamics: Integrating diverse data types (DNA, RNA, proteins) and capturing temporal/spatial dynamics (e.g., cell-state changes) exceeds current model capabilities.

Architectural Limitations:

Sequence Length: Genomes are orders of magnitude longer than text sequences, challenging Transformer-based models with limited context windows.

3D Structure Ignorance: Models often ignore chromatin folding or epigenetic spatial interactions critical for gene regulation.

Learning Paradigms:

Ineffective Self-Supervision: Tasks like masked nucleotide prediction may not capture higher-order biological functions (e.g., gene ontology, pathway interactions).

Task Specificity: Broad pre-training may miss nuances required for specialized tasks (e.g., CRISPR knockout effects).

Evaluation and Interpretability:

Misaligned Metrics: Model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy) may not correlate with biological relevance or clinical utility.

Black-Box Nature: Biologists require mechanistic insights, but foundation models often lack interpretability.

Ethical and Practical Barriers:

Validation Costs: Experimental validation is slow and expensive, hindering iterative model refinement.

Regulatory Hurdles: Compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) complicates data sharing and reuse.

Emerging Solutions:

Improved Architectures: Hierarchical or sparse Transformers to handle long sequences; graph neural networks for interaction networks.

Better Pretraining Tasks: Incorporating gene ontology, pathway data, or synthetic data to enhance biological relevance.

Multi-modal Integration: Combining omics with imaging, clinical data, or literature to enrich context.

Active Learning: Prioritizing high-impact experiments to reduce validation costs.
